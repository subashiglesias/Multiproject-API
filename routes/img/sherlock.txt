Oh, she has turned all the menâ€™s heads downin that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonneton this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, toa man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drivesout at five every day, and returns at seven sharpfor dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, exceptwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, buta good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, anddashing, never calls less than once a day, and oftentwice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the InnerTemple.
